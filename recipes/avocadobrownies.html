    <p>Recipe taken from Detoxinista. Check out their recipe <a href="https://detoxinista.com/avocado-brownies/">here</a>. Gluten-free.</p>
    <p>Avocado is used as a substitute for oil or butter, making these brownies contain more fibre and nutrients in each bite than your regular chocolate brownies. Feel free to substitute flour with almond flour, sugar with coconut sugar etc. and make this recipe uniquely yours.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>201 g ripe avocado</li>
        <li>43 g cacao powder</li>
        <li>88 g eggs</li>
        <li>160 g brown sugar</li>
        <li>62.5 g butter</li>
        <li>4 g baking powder</li>
        <li>4 g vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1.5 g fine sea salt</li>
        <li>90 g dark chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325ºF <em>(or 162ºC)</em> and line a 9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper. <em>(Grease the pan first, so the parchment paper will stay in place.)</em></li>
        <br>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the avocado <em>(peel and pit removed)</em>, cacao powder, eggs, coconut sugar, almond butter, baking powder, vanilla, and salt. Process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed.</li>

        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips, then pour the batter into the prepared pan. <em>(TIP:Decorate the top with a few extra chocolate chips, if desired.)</em></li>

        <li>Bake at 325ºF <em>(or 162ºC)</em> for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the center of the brownies looks cooked-through. <em>(You don't want it to jiggle when you shake the pan.)</em></li>

        <li>Allow the brownies to cool completely. The avocado flavor is MUCH more pronounced if you try these warm, so please don't be tempted to taste them until they have come to room temperature. You can place them in the fridge if you want to speed up the cooling process, or you'll have to wait at least 2 hours for them to cool on the counter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Slice the brownies into small squares and serve. It's normal for this brownie to stick to the knife a bit with you cut them, since they are flourless and very fudgy. Leftovers can be stored on the counter for up to 48 hours, or in the fridge in an airtight container for up to a week.</li>
