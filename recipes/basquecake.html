    <h3>📦  Description:</h3>
    <p>Recipe taken from Just One Cookbook. Check out their recipe <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/matcha-basque-cheesecake/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The classic Basque cheesecake with a Japanese twist. (抹茶バスクチーズケーキ) It keeps it's iconic burnt exterior while having a green, creamy interior. This recipe also calls for less cream, more egg than usual, making it extra light and fluffy. You can substitute the matcha with lemon juice if you happen to hate matcha (which is quite unfortunate). </p>

    <h3>📦  Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>226 g cream cheese</li>
        <li>100 g sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>6 g matcha</li>
        <li>11 g cake flour</li>
        <li>6 g cornstarch</li>
        <li>220 ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>⅛ tsp table salt</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>📦  Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF <em>(230ºC)</em>. If you don’t have an oven with a fan, preheat a conventional oven to 475ºF <em>(245ºC)</em>.</li>
        
        <h4><u>🌰 To prepare the cake tray:</u></h4>
        <li>For 1 6-inch <em>(15-cm)</em> round cake pan, prepare 2 rectangular sheets of parchment paper long enough to hang over the sides by 2 inches <em>(5 cm)</em>. Place them crisscross to maximize the coverage on all sides. <em>(You can use just one sheet instead of two if your parchment paper is extra wide.)</em> Fold them twice into quarters, like a paper napkin.</li>

        <li>Open the folded sheets and place them crisscross as before. Find the center point of the crisscrossed sheets. Where the creases intersect will also indicate the center of the cake pan. Center the parchment sheets over the cake pan ring, then center the removable bottom on top of the sheets.</li>

        <li>Press down the removable bottom and the parchment sheets into the cake pan, creasing the paper against the bottom and inside of the pan to fit snugly. Press and crease the paper edges down around the outside of the cake pan, too.</li>

        <li>Gently take out both the removable bottom and the parchment sheets, which are now molded into the shape of the pan. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then, fit the molded parchment paper back into the cake pan on top of the removable bottom. Press the paper down to fit snugly.</li>

        <h4><u>🌰 To prepare the cheesecake mixture:</u></h4>
        <li>Place 226 g cream cheese in a large bowl. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave it in 15-second increments until it's at room temperature.</li> <br>
        <li>Press down on the cream cheese with a spatula to soften it. Then, add 100 g sugar.</li> <br>
        <li>Combine the cream cheese with the sugar by rubbing the mixture against the sides of the bowl with the spatula. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules dissolve. Scrape both the bowl and spatula often to ensure that the ingredients are well incorporated and there are no lumps.</li>

        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk 2 large eggs and 1 large egg yolk well.</li> <br>
        <li>Slowly and gradually add one-third of the beaten eggs to the cream cheese mixture. Blend completely and thoroughly, making sure the batter is smooth and without lumps before adding more egg.</li> <br>
        <li>Add another one-third of the eggs to the cream cheese mixture, blending completely.</li> <br>
        <li>Add the remaining egg and blend well.</li> <br>
        <li>With a ladle, transfer about two scoops of the batter to a clean, medium-sized bowl.</li> <br>
        <li>Now, blend in the matcha. Use a small, fine-mesh sieve to sift 6 g matcha into the two scoops of batter, a little bit at a time. Stir as you go to blend the powder into the batter completely before adding more. Continue until you‘ve sifted and blended in all the matcha. <em>Tip: Matcha is a fine powder that becomes lumpy if you add it to a large volume of liquid. Therefore, we have to make a paste with the matcha before adding it to the rest of the batter.</em></li> <br>
        <li>Mix it all together, making sure there are no lumps and that the matcha is well incorporated into the liquid. Now, it is a thick batter. Continue to blend until the matcha batter is completely smooth and without lumps. Then, add one more scoop of the main batter and blend well to loosen up the matcha batter further.</li> <br>
        <li>Now transfer the matcha batter back into the main batter. Blend the two batters very well until you have a smooth consistency.</li>

        <li>Next, add 11 g cake flour and 6 g cornstarch to a fine-mesh sieve. Holding the sieve in one hand, sift a little bit of the flour and cornstarch into the cream cheese mixture while you stir with a spatula. Incorporate the ingredients well before adding more. Keep sifting and blending until you‘ve added all the flour mixture. Take your time doing this. You don’t want any lumps.</li> <br>
        <li>Make sure at this stage that there are no lumps. Then, gradually add 220 ml heavy cream while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined. Add ⅛ tsp table salt and blend it all together.</li> <br>
        <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so you don't create any air pockets.</li> <br>
        <li>Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times to eliminate air pockets. With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any. Then, run the skewer through the batter to remove any bubbles.</li>

        <li>Since the cheesecake may overflow during baking, place the cake pan on a baking sheet, just in case. Next, transfer the baking sheet with the cake pan to the oven. Bake at 230ºC for a convection oven or 245ºC for a conventional oven. Bake until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30 minutes; please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different. <br> <em>If you love a “gooey“ or “oozy“ texture, then you may bake for less time than I suggested, but you must chill your cake well to firm it up before serving. NEVER extend the bake time and thus overcook the cake, even if the top hasn‘t turned dark. The filling will curdle and you can‘t fix it.</em></li> <br>
        <li>Take out the cake when the surface is dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2–3 hours.</li>
